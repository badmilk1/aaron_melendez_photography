# [Project LadyBoy](https://github.com/bgroveben/project_ladyboy)  
`Create a comprehensive online identity for Aaron and his projects.`    

Your collection of internet properties and brands will be networked, basically.  
It will be easier to keep track of (as well as interact with) your audience and their interests, as well as cultivate a relationship with your followers as a group.  
It will also be easier to keep track of all of your creative works, social media accounts, clients, and so forth.  

Since you already familiar with Google Cloud, and Google Photos has unlimited free storage for compressed images, I'm going to focus my attention on that platform for the things that we will be working on:
* [Google Marketing Platform ](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/small-business/)  
* [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g#welcome)  
* [Google Sites (eventually)](https://sites.google.com/new?pli=1)
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive)
* [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/?tab=vq&pageId=none)

Deep breaths Aaron.  
You don't have to learn about all of this, there is no test, and just looking at the information in the links for a few minutes is enough to get you up to speed.  
All you have to do for now is:  
* [Transfer Instagram Photos to Google Photos](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-transfer-my-pictures-to-Instagram-from-Google-Photos)
* [Transfer images and videos from your external drive or internal storage to Google Photos. AKA back your stuff up in the cloud.](https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/)  

See, you got this! ;)  
Read all of that again after you get a hot drink and some fresh fruit, and we can move on.
